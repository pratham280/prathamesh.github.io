abstract: This paper presents the design and development of a low-cost quadruped robot inspired by Boston Dynamics‚Äô Spot, aimed at academic and research accessibility. Utilizing ESP32 and Raspberry Pi as the control units, the robot integrates MG996 servo motors, an MPU6050 IMU, ultrasonic sensors, and an ESP32-CAM for terrain navigation and surveillance. The system features 3D-printed modular components and a custom web interface for control and video streaming. Stable locomotion was achieved using crawl and trot gaits with real-time posture correction enabled by sensor fusion and PID control. The robot serves as a cost-effective, extensible platform for exploring legged locomotion, embedded systems, and autonomous mobility.

## Low-Cost Quadruped Robot

This project showcases the development of a low-cost quadruped robot built using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. Inspired by Boston Dynamics' Spot, the goal was to create an accessible platform for students and researchers to explore legged locomotion, posture control, and basic remote surveillance. By combining off-the-shelf electronics with 3D-printed mechanical components, the robot achieves stable walking and real-time video streaming at a significantly lower cost.

The hardware architecture includes ESP32 as the low-level controller responsible for servo actuation and sensor data processing, while the Raspberry Pi manages higher-level tasks such as hosting the web interface and handling video streams. Each leg is driven by three MG996R servo motors, providing two degrees of freedom‚Äîhip and knee‚Äîfor executing crawl and trot gait patterns. Orientation feedback is enabled through the MPU6050 IMU, helping the robot maintain a level posture during movement. For vision and monitoring, an ESP32-CAM module streams live video to a browser-based dashboard built with Flask.

The robot is powered by a 3S 4000mAh Li-ion battery, regulated using a buck converter to supply stable voltages to servos and logic components. The modular 3D-printed frame, designed in Fusion 360, simplifies both assembly and maintenance, making it ideal for iterative prototyping. Components such as servo brackets, sensor mounts, and the main control hub were designed to fit snugly into the printed body.

A key feature of this platform is its responsive web interface, accessible over Wi-Fi from any PC or smartphone. The interface provides manual control via keyboard or joystick, as well as a live video feed for remote navigation. Communication between the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi is achieved through UART serial, with optional fallback to Wi-Fi.

This robot serves as an excellent entry point into quadruped robotics, real-time embedded programming, and robotic perception systems. Future improvements could include integration with computer vision libraries for object tracking, use of LIDAR for SLAM-based mapping, or implementation of adaptive gaits through machine learning. The entire system was built on a modest budget of approximately ‚Çπ12,000‚Äì14,000, making it highly suitable for academic projects, robotics clubs, and early-stage research.
