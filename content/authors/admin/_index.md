    awarder: E-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC)
    icon: eyrc
    summary: |
      - I participated in the 15th edition of the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) under the theme Astro Tinker, where we developed an FPGA-based line-following robot for a space-themed, task-oriented arena. 
      - As part of this project-based learning module, we designed and implemented a custom RISC-V CPU architecture on the FPGA to run the robotâ€™s path planning algorithm. The robot autonomously navigated, monitored environmental conditions, and executed pick-and-place operations using sensor feedback. This experience strengthened my understanding of digital logic design, embedded control, and FPGA-based system development.

    summary: |
      I participated in Robotex India, where I developed two competition-ready robots: an advanced line follower and a maze-solving robot, securing 7th and 2nd place respectively. The line follower featured a PID control system, high-speed IR sensor array, and a custom-designed PCB for optimized performance. The maze solver demonstrated intelligent path-planning and adaptability under real-time constraints. Our performance qualified us for the international finals at Robotex Global, highlighting both our technical competence and competitive excellence.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
